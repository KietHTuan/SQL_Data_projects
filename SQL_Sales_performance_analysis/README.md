# Sales Performance Dashboard Project

## Executive Summary
**Data Analyst**: Kiet Tuan  
This project involves designing and developing a comprehensive **Sales Performance Dashboard** for a fictional company. It simulates a real-world scenario where a stakeholder requests an interactive and insightful dashboard to analyze the companyâ€™s sales data.

The project demonstrates my ability to perform **data wrangling**, **analysis**, and **visualization** to support informed decision-making, with a focus on leveraging SQL skills for efficient data handling.

## Project Goals:
Create an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard that includes:
- **Total Sales** and **Order Count** metrics
- **Average Monthly Sales** and **Orders**
- **Freight Costs to Sales Ratio**
- **Average Spending per Customer**

### Visualizations:
- **Bar Graphs**: Total sales from product category and subcategory
- **Line Graphs**: Sales trends (with trend line) and accumulated order count trends
- **Map**: Sales distribution by location

## SQL Skills Highlighted:
1. **Loading to SQL Database**:
   - Assess the dataset for suitability for a relational database.
   - Choose appropriate tables for storing the data.
   - Perform **table mapping** to ensure data integrity and relationships.

2. **Data Wrangling**:
   - **Data Structuring**: Organize and structure raw data into SQL tables for efficient querying.
   - **Data Integration**: Combine multiple tables and data sources for a unified dataset.
   - **Data Enrichment**: Enhance the dataset by adding calculated fields or aggregated metrics using SQL.

3. **Data Analysis** (SQL-based):
   - Calculate key metrics such as **total sales**, **average monthly sales**, and **freight costs to sales ratio**.
   - Apply a **moving average** to smooth sales data trends.
   - Compute **accumulated order count** over time using SQL queries.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create an interactive dashboard using **Tableau** to display insights derived from SQL queries.

## Deliverables:
1. **SQL Database**: Data structured and analyzed using SQL queries.
2. **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**: Visualizations of sales metrics and trends.

## Observations:
- The company achieved approximately **$110 million** in sales from 2011 to 2014, with a total of **121,317 orders**.
- **Sales revenue peaked in 2013**.
- The most popular products are **bikes** (road bikes: $44M, mountain bikes: $36.5M).
- **Sales distribution**: Primarily in **North America** ($63M), with secondary markets in **Australia-Pacific** ($10.6M) and **Europe** (France, Denmark, Great Britain).
